## Description

###This is a project that allows the user to order a pizzas and determines the total cost based on customer selections. It also meets the following criteria:
* Allows the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Allows users to order more than one pizza with different toppings
* Displays the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details
* Offers delivery option that then requires address information

This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing. A link to the live site is provided below:
