//TODO:
// Create a website for a pizza company where a user can order a pizza and see the final cost:

// Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
// Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
// Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
//
//
//When you finish, submit it at the JavaScript OO link on Epicenter. Your teachers will review your code based on the following criteria:
//
// Code meets standards from previous weeks
// Objects drive business logic (in JavaScript not jQuery)
// Specs written for JavaScript functions
// Constructors and prototypes used successfully
// Web application works as expected

//TODO: EXTRA
// style your site with CSS and images
// allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings
// display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details
// offer a delivery option that then requires address information
